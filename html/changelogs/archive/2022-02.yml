      even fall at all!). This has been corrected to allow you to punt them down to

      tied mains).
  LemonInTheDark:
  - bugfix: Hopefully fixes sparks just, sitting in the air sometimes. At the very
      least it'll cause more visible complaints
  Melbert:
  - rscadd: Large scale heretic revamp!
  - expansion: The Codex Cicatrix is no longer a roundstart heretic item. Research
      is handled through their antag info UI. Rune drawing is done by using a writing
      tool with Mansus Grasp active in your offhand. The actual Codex is an unlockable
      ritual item now.
  - expansion: The Living Heart is no longer a roundstart heretic item - their actual
      heart now becomes their Living Heart, and it makes a sound when triggered. Losing
      your heart (being disemboweled) will require you to do a ritual to regain it.
  - expansion: The Hereic Antag UI has been overhauled, and now hosts much of their
      mechanics as well as providing some helpful tips for newer players.
  - expansion: Most heretic spells now require a focus to cast. All heretics can make
      a basic focus necklace, and some heretic equipment also functions as a focus.
      (Credit to Imaginos for the focus sprite!)
  - expansion: Heretics now passively gain +1 influence every 20 minutes.
  - expansion: Heretic sacrificing  has been reworked. You can now sacrifice people
      who are in soft crit or weaker. Sacrificing someone heals them, cuffs them,
      and teleports them to the SHADOW REALM, where they must dodge a barrage of hands
      to survive. Survive long enough and you return without memory - die, and your
      body will be thrown back.
  - expansion: Heretics now have a few new rituals, including the Ritual of Knowledge,
      a randomly generated ritual that awards knowledge points.
  - expansion: Heretic ascension now has a few requirements - you must complete your
      objectives assigned to you prior to learning the final ritual, and all the final
      rituals have been changed a bit!
  - qol: 'Using the Heretic''s Mansus Grasp on surfaces (EX: Rust Grasp) now works
      on right-click, instead of combat mode.'

      can only have up to 2 heretic blades crafted at once (3 if you are Path of Flesh).
  - balance: The Lord of the Night has been buffed to be a little scarier. Did you
      know the Lord of the Night can eat arms to regain body parts and heal?
  - balance: Buffed some heretic summons - mostly their health pools.
  - balance: Nerfed the heretic's Mask of Madness. It can no longer infinite stam-crit
      you.
  - balance: Nerfed the heretic's ash mark.
  - balance: 'Nerfed a bunch of on-hit-heretic-blade effects. Many effects only apply
      on mark detonation now: Void blade silence, flesh blade wounds, ash blade gasp
      cooldown refund.'
  - bugfix: Fixed quite a few bugs and unintended behaviors with heretic code.

      dramatically.

      Storage Room.
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen has come out with a new way to define the loot-laden maintenance
      tunnels of KiloStation. This shouldn't affect anything more than just how they
      get their power, though.
  - rscadd: On KiloStation, there is now a door between Fore and Fore/Starboard Maintenance.
      I hope this helps you sleep better at night.
  - bugfix: If you've been noticing some very-dark plating outside of Engineering,
      it has now been fixed.

  - balance: Kudzu now stops spreading if the tile it is on is under 100K without
      the cold-proofing mutation.
  - balance: Kudzu now has a severity system for mutations. Different mutations cost
      different severity based on their effects. There is a maximum severity which
      is dependent on potency, while more severe mutations also are rarer.
  - balance: Kudzu's maximum severity is now a linear function of its potency, with
      it ranging from 10 to 20.
  - balance: Kudzu's maximum spread cap per seed is now 2/3 of its old value.

      for traits
